# My Job

 1. Attract and Retain World-Class Talent
 2. Set context

That's it
 - If I do something that negatively impacts my ability to retain you, you would be doing me a **huge** favor if you let me know about it, as soon as possible
 - If I do something that feels more like telling you how to do your job than setting context, you'd be doing me a **huge** favor if you let me know about it, as soon as possible

# How I Approach My Job
 - I am not an authoritarian 
 - I believe in and practice [servant leadership](https://www.greenleaf.org/what-is-servant-leadership/)
 - My role is to make sure the team has the skills, space, and context to ship great software for our customers
 - I realize that working in this company & role may be just one step along your career path
 - I am here to help you progress in your professional life (to whatever goals you want)

I value:

 - Empowerment
 - Growth/development/coaching
 - Teamwork
 - Transparency

# Personality Quirks

 - I'm terrible at remembering names and faces
	 - This can make me come across as a little standoffish with people I don't interact with every day
	 - Don't be alarmed / offended if I ask you to remind me of your name
 - I can be hard to read
	 - I'm usually just deep in thought and have no awareness of my facial expression - just ask me if something is bothering me. Usually not.
 - I can be too serious / intense
	 - Please remind me to loosen up once in a while
 - I'm not as self-aware as I'd like to be
	 - Please report additional quirks [here](https://github.com/daronstinnett/readme/issues)


 # Feedback
 
 - I really, **really** appreciate direct feedback - especially about things I could be doing better. No matter where in the org chart I am relative to you, please tell me if there's something you think I could be doing better. I love to improve and sometimes I simply don't know where I'm falling short and I rely on my friends an coworkers to shine a light on my blind spots (see self-awareness above)
 - Positive feedback is great too - though sometimes I struggle to take it gracefully

# Want to talk?
 - I am in a lot of meetings
 - Very few of them are more important than spending time talking with you if you want to talk with me
 - Feel entirely free to put time on my calendar to talk whenever you want
